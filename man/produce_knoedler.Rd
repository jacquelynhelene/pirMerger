\description{
This is a two-stage process. First, the raw, mostly denormalized exports are
read in, and then normalized into a series of tables. Secondly, IDs for
artists, buyers, sellers, objects, and transaction & inventory events are
generated and attached to the reamining core `knoedler` table.
